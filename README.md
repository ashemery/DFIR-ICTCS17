**Abstract**  
Crime committed on computers or information stored on computers is rapidly increasing, especially when our daily lives have become more reliant on devices and digital information. This "Digital Forensics and Incident Response" workshop will focus on two of the most critical fields in all of information security. It will help participants gain both the theoretical and practical skills required to perform digital forensic investigations and respond to computer incidents, by applying hands-on experience with realworld scenarios. The goal of the workshop is to inspire the interest of participants with diverse backgrounds, spread the awareness of fighting cybercrime, and build a better DFIR community. Keywords: Digital Forensics, DFIR, Incident Response, Investigation

**Description**  
The Digital Forensics and Incident Response Workshop focuses on identifying, investigating, and remeidating computer network exploitation. DFIR1 is a broad field and this workshop will serve as your first step in fighting against cyber crime. In particular, it will show and cover the following:
- Introduction to Digital Forensics and Incident Response,
- Trending Research Areas,
- Disk Imaging, Mounting, and Verification,
- File Carving and File analysis,
- Working with Autopsy, Searching and indexing,
- Analyzing Internet history, Thumbnails and Prefetch Files,
- Basic Windows Registry Analysis,
- Generating Reports,
- Extra: Performing Basic DFIR Triage from Collection to Analysis.

**Requirements for the participants**  
To be able to participate in the hands-on sessions during the workshop you will need a Laptop with your prefered operating system and a virtual machine hypervisor such as Virtualbox2 or VMWare3 installed. You will need to download a Windows VM (preferably 7/8)4 , and the CyLR CDQR Forensics Virtual Machine (CCF-VM)5 . Finally, you will also need to download a number of digital forensic tools. The full list will be announced one week before the workshop.

**Provided materials**  
The material and all the instructions will be publicly available on a dedicated Github repository. The repository will be announced at the workshop. You are invited to contribute, open issues and ask questions there after the workshop. The final materials will be published after the workshop day.
